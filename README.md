Welcome to **Stress! The Game**: A local multiplayer videogame rendition of the classic card game Stress, combining the fast pace nature of the original game with the visual appeal of a videogame.

Challenge a friend (or foe!) to this quick battle of wits and strategy, and remember, speed is the name of the game!

## Rules

**Objective**: Clear all your cards as fast as possible.

**Stress! The Game** uses a slightly different ruleset from the original card game [Stress](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Stress-(Card-Game)). 

As per the original rules, each player will start with 26 cards (half of a standard pack of cards), with one card being placed on different piles to start.

On top of stacking consecutive cards in ascending or descending order, our game adds a new twist: **cards can be stacked if both cards have the same rank**! This provides more opportunities for players to interrupt the flow of the game and disrupt their opponent, while making them consider their card choices wisely.

The highlight of the game is **calling Stress!**â€”a fast-paced challenge that keeps players on their toes. When *both piles show cards of the same rank*, either player can call Stress! The slower player must collect all the cards from both piles and add them to their deck, putting them at a disadvantage.

To combat button mashing, players are penalised for incorrect moves, with their controls going on cooldown for:  
* 1 second (on an invalid card throw)  
* 2 seconds (on an invalid stress call)  

**Be quick, but accurate!**
